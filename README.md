# JS to TS Conversion
This repository demonstrates the process of converting JavaScript code to TypeScript without changing the file extension. The code includes type annotations for basic data types (number, boolean, string).
# What is this program?
This project showcases fundamental TypeScript operations, such as arithmetic functions, array manipulation, classes, asynchronous tasks, and closures. It also illustrates how to work with objects, interfaces, recursion, and various data handling techniques. The program includes examples of calculations, array and object manipulations, as well as handling promises and asynchronous functions.
